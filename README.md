# SokobanFX

From Wikipedia:

_"Sokoban is a type of transport puzzle, in which the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get 
them to storage locations. The puzzle is usually implemented as a video game.
Sokoban was created in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and published in 1982 by Thinking Rabbit, a software house based in 
Takarazuka, Japan."_

## About this project

I created this game as part of my Object-Oriented Analysis and Design course. I initially coded it using Java Swing for
the GUI,but soon after I decided to recreate it using **JavaFX**, just for the sake of learning how to use it.
